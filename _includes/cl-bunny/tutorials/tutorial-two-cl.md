# RabbitMQ tutorial - Work Queues

## Work Queues

### (using [cl-bunny](http://cl-rabbit.io/cl-bunny))

![](http://i.imgur.com/Tf7ltsH.png)

In the [first tutorial](tutorial-one-cl.html) we
wrote programs to send and receive messages from a named queue. In this
one we'll create a _Work Queue_ that will be used to distribute
time-consuming tasks among multiple workers.

The main idea behind Work Queues (aka: _Task Queues_) is to avoid
doing a resource-intensive task immediately and having to wait for
it to complete. Instead we schedule the task to be done later. We encapsulate a
_task_ as a message and send it to a queue. A worker process running
in the background will pop the tasks and eventually execute the
job. When you run many workers the tasks will be shared between them.

This concept is especially useful in web applications where it's
impossible to handle a complex task during a short HTTP request
window.

Preparation
------------

In the previous part of this tutorial we sent a message containing
"Hello World!". Now we'll be sending strings that stand for complex
tasks. We don't have a real-world task, like images to be resized or
pdf files to be rendered, so let's fake it by just pretending we're
busy - by using the `sleep` function. We'll take the number of dots
in the string as its complexity; every dot will account for one second
of "work".  For example, a fake task described by `Hello...`
will take three seconds.

We will slightly modify the _send.lisp_ code from our previous example,
to allow arbitrary messages to be sent from the command line. This
program will schedule tasks to our work queue, so let's name it
`new_task.lisp`:

    (with-connection ("amqp://")
      (with-channel ()
        (let ((x (default-exchange))
              (msg (format nil "~{~a ~}" (cdr sb-ext:*posix-argv*))))
          (publish x msg :routing-key "task_queue"
                         :properties `((:persistent . ,t)))
          (format t " [x] Sent '~a'~%" msg))))


Our old _receive.lisp_ script also requires some changes: it needs to
fake a second of work for every dot in the message body. It will pop
messages from the queue and perform the task, so let's call it `worker.lisp`:

    (with-connection ("amqp://")
      (with-channel ()
        (let ((q (queue.declare "task_queue" :auto-delete t)))
          (format t " [*] Waiting for messages in queue 'task_queue'. To exit type (exit)~%")
          (subscribe q (lambda (message)
                         (let ((body (babel:octets-to-string (message-body message))))
                           (format t " [x] Received ~a~%" body)
                           ;; imitate some work
                           (sleep (count #\. body))
                           (print " [x] Done~%"))) 
                     :type :sync)
          (consume :one-shot t))))

    

Note that our fake task simulates execution time.

Run them as in tutorial one:

    shell1$ sbcl --load worker.lisp
    shell2$ sbcl --load new_task.lisp

Round-robin dispatching
-----------------------

One of the advantages of using a Task Queue is the ability to easily
parallelise work. If we are building up a backlog of work, we can just
add more workers and that way, scale easily.

First, let's try to run two `worker.rb` scripts at the same time. They
will both get messages from the queue, but how exactly? Let's see.

You need three consoles open. Two will run the `worker.rb`
script. These consoles will be our two consumers - C1 and C2.

    shell1$ sbcl --load worker.lisp
     [*] Waiting for messages. To exit type (exit)

    shell2$ sbcl --load worker.lisp
     [*] Waiting for messages. To exit type (exit)

In the third one we'll publish new tasks. Once you've started
the consumers you can publish a few messages:

    shell3$ sbcl --non-interactive --load new_task.lisp First message.
    shell3$ sbcl --non-interactive --load new_task.lisp Second message..
    shell3$ sbcl --non-interactive --load new_task.lisp Third message...
    shell3$ sbcl --non-interactive --load new_task.lisp Fourth message....
    shell3$ sbcl --non-interactive --load new_task.lisp Fifth message.....

Let's see what is delivered to our workers:

    shell1$ sbcl --load worker.lisp
     [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C
     [x] Received 'First message.'
     [x] Received 'Third message...'
     [x] Received 'Fifth message.....'

    shell2$ sbcl --load worker.lisp
     [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C
     [x] Received 'Second message..'
     [x] Received 'Fourth message....'

By default, RabbitMQ will send each message to the next consumer,
in sequence. On average every consumer will get the same number of
messages. This way of distributing messages is called round-robin. Try
this out with three or more workers.


Message acknowledgment
----------------------

Doing a task can take a few seconds. You may wonder what happens if
one of the consumers starts a long task and dies with it only partly done.
With our current code, once RabbitMQ delivers a message to the customer it
immediately removes it from memory. In this case, if you kill a worker
we will lose the message it was just processing. We'll also lose all
the messages that were dispatched to this particular worker but were not
yet handled.

But we don't want to lose any tasks. If a worker dies, we'd like the
task to be delivered to another worker.

In order to make sure a message is never lost, RabbitMQ supports
message _acknowledgments_. An ack(nowledgement) is sent back from the
consumer to tell RabbitMQ that a particular message has been received,
processed and that RabbitMQ is free to delete it.

If a consumer dies without sending an ack, RabbitMQ will understand that a
message wasn't processed fully and will redeliver it to another
consumer. That way you can be sure that no message is lost, even if
the workers occasionally die.

There aren't any message timeouts; RabbitMQ will redeliver the message
only when the worker connection dies. It's fine even if processing a
message takes a very, very long time.

Message acknowledgments are turned off by default.
It's time to turn them on using the `:manual_ack` option and send a proper acknowledgment
from the worker, once we're done with a task.

    (subscribe q (lambda (message) 
      (let ((body (babel:octets-to-string (message-body message))))
        (format t " [x] Received ~a" body)
        ;; imitate some work
        (sleep (count #\. body))
        (print " [x] Done")
        (message-ack message)))
      :no-ack t
      :type :sync)

Using this code we can be sure that even if you kill a worker using
CTRL+C while it was processing a message, nothing will be lost. Soon
after the worker dies all unacknowledged messages will be redelivered.

>     hello    0       0
>     ...done.


Message durability
------------------

We have learned how to make sure that even if the consumer dies, the
task isn't lost. But our tasks will still be lost if RabbitMQ server stops.

When RabbitMQ quits or crashes it will forget the queues and messages
unless you tell it not to. Two things are required to make sure that
messages aren't lost: we need to mark both the queue and messages as
durable.

First, we need to make sure that RabbitMQ will never lose our
queue. In order to do so, we need to declare it as _durable_:

    (queue.declare "hello" :durable t)

Although this command is correct by itself, it won't work in our present
setup. That's because we've already defined a queue called `hello`
which is not durable. RabbitMQ doesn't allow you to redefine an existing queue
with different parameters and will return an error to any program
that tries to do that. But there is a quick workaround - let's declare
a queue with different name, for example `task_queue`:

    (queue.declare "task_queue" :durable t)

This `:durable` option change needs to be applied to both the producer
and consumer code.

At this point we're sure that the `task_queue` queue won't be lost
even if RabbitMQ restarts. Now we need to mark our messages as persistent
- by using the `:persistent` option `publish` takes via `:properties` as alist item.

    (publish x msg :properties `((:persistent . ,t)))

> #### Note on message persistence
>
> Marking messages as persistent doesn't fully guarantee that a message
> won't be lost. Although it tells RabbitMQ to save the message to disk,
> there is still a short time window when RabbitMQ has accepted a message and
> hasn't saved it yet. Also, RabbitMQ doesn't do `fsync(2)` for every
> message -- it may be just saved to cache and not really written to the
> disk. The persistence guarantees aren't strong, but it's more than enough
> for our simple task queue. If you need a stronger guarantee then you can use
> [publisher confirms](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html).


Fair dispatch
----------------

You might have noticed that the dispatching still doesn't work exactly
as we want. For example in a situation with two workers, when all
odd messages are heavy and even messages are light, one worker will be
constantly busy and the other one will do hardly any work. Well,
RabbitMQ doesn't know anything about that and will still dispatch
messages evenly.

This happens because RabbitMQ just dispatches a message when the message
enters the queue. It doesn't look at the number of unacknowledged
messages for a consumer. It just blindly dispatches every n-th message
to the n-th consumer.

![](http://i.imgur.com/z9KeMZ3.png)

In order to defeat that we can use the `prefetch` method with the
value of `1`. This tells RabbitMQ not to give more than
one message to a worker at a time. Or, in other words, don't dispatch
a new message to a worker until it has processed and acknowledged the
previous one. Instead, it will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy.

    (with-cahnnel ()
      (let ((n 1))
        (setf (channel-prefetch cl-bunny::*channel*) n)))

> #### Note about queue size
>
> If all the workers are busy, your queue can fill up. You will want to keep an
> eye on that, and maybe add more workers, or have some other strategy.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

Final code of our `new_task.lisp` class:

    (with-connection ("amqp://")
      (with-channel ()
        (let ((x (default-exchange))
              (msg (format nil "~{~a ~}" (cdr sb-ext:*posix-argv*))))
          (publish x msg :routing-key "task_queue"
                         :properties `((:persistent . ,t)))
          (format t " [x] Sent '~a'~%" msg)
          (sleep 1))))


[(new_task.lisp source)](code/new_task.lisp)

And our `worker.lisp`:

    (with-connection ("amqp://")
      (with-channel ()
        (let ((n 1)
              (q (queue.declare "task_queue" :auto-delete t :durable t)))
          (format t " [*] Waiting for messages in queue 'task_queue'. To exit type (exit)~%")
          (setf (channel-prefetch cl-bunny::*channel*) n)
          (subscribe q (lambda (message)
                         (let ((body (babel:octets-to-string (message-body message))))
                           (format t " [x] Received ~a~%" body)
                           ;; imitate some work
                           (sleep (count #\. body))
                           (print " [x] Done~%")
                           (message-ack message)))                       
                     :no-ack t
                     :type :sync)
          (consume :one-shot t))))

Using message acknowledgments and `channel-prefetch` you can set up a
work queue. The durability options let the tasks survive even if
RabbitMQ is restarted.

For more information on functions and message properties, you can browse the
[cl-bunny reference](http://cl-rabbit.io/cl-bunny/reference).

Now we can move on to [tutorial 3](tutorial-three-cl.html) and learn how
to deliver the same message to many consumers.
